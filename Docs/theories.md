Flash memory can decay under certain conditions - but none that the Chromebook will ever be in, so let's not even bother considering this one,\

2. Server-Side Bug\
chromeOS is kinda held together by birch wood & rusty nails. It's safe to assume that the server-side components were made the same way. There's a chance that the server has a "fallback mode" where if the Chromebook doesn't communicate with it for 15 hours, it'll just unenroll you, but why even have a fallback mode in the first place?\
