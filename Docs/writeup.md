Someone once gave me ~5 various octopus Chromebooks they found, all of which were enrolled. I messed around with them, powerwashing & restarting a bunch, and ended up leaving them in my closet. A few days later I gave them back to my friend, and they were all unenrolled? I didn't bother looking into it for a while. But Scaretek had an idea to form a new exploiting group! And I remembered this thing I had found. So I pulled out one of my extra nissa Chromebooks to test, and... it was unenrolled. I remember how I \[october 1st] and ended up messing around in the OOBE for a while before putting it in my closet again. So I tried restarting once on the enrollment screen, waiting a day, and... it didn't work. I then tried restarting twice instead of once, checked it at midnight, and it actually worked this time!!
![[/Docs/Images/unenrolled.png]] I knew this meant something, so I tracked the time it took. 15 hours. I decided I needed someone else to test this and wait 15 hours for, and it worked for them too! I had to see how far I could get the time down. 8 hours? 4 hours? So I kept experimenting.

Hai Hazel I will write more soon :3
