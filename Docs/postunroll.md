## Developer Mode
*This will wipe your data!*
After CRSH2TTING yourself, on the "Choose your Chromebook's setup" screen, you can press `power + esc + refresh` to enter recovery mode.

  If your recovery screen is white, press `ctrl + d` then `enter` to enable developer mode. To boot, press `ctrl + d` at the "OS Verification is Off" screen.
  
  If your recovery screen is grey, use the arrow keys to navigate to "Advanced", then press "Enable Developer Mode". To boot, select the "internal disk" option when turning your Chromebook on.
## Fullrom
