##  How do I do it?
1. Powerwash (press `ctrl + alt + shift + r` on the login screen)
2. Proceed through setup as normal
3. When it starts to enroll, wait 2 seconds then restart by pressing `power + refresh`
4. When it starts to enroll again, wait 2 seconds and press `esc + power + refresh` then `power` to turn it off
5. Leave it off for ***at least*** 15 hours
6. When you turn it on, it should look like [this](https://github.com/kuromuiroha/CRSH2TTY/raw/main/Docs/Media/v128nissa.mp4) or something similar. You're unenrolled!
